# Minimizing the Mean Square Error Objective Function

## Problem Description
The purpose of this project is to apply Newton's Method (NM) and the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) Method to a data-fitting problem and present our analytical and numerical results. We will also explore the Davidson-Fletcher-Poewll (DFP) Method to fit our data. 

## Overview
The report attached is meant to complement and further explain the results produced by the code. The "Introduction" and "Problem Description" sections introduce the three iterative methods used and the general problem description. The "Mathematical Formulation" section of the report really dives into the algorithms used. The "Experimental Results and Discussion" section is where I present and explain to the best of my abilities the results of the 5 experiments conducted. Lastly, the "Conclusion" section is where I summarize my work and give the overall conclusions.
